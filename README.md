# Flutter EduCamp - Vietnamese Language

## Introduction

This project tracks my progress on this course https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/learn/lecture/14482142 by Angela Yu.

To spice things up, I'll create my own version of the exercises using the theme Vietnamese Language.
 The app will be available on the stores to serve both as a demo for intermediate programmer to
 learnDart and for anyone who interested in the Vietnamese language.

The app will have 9 sections / mini-app in same order as the course:
1. Image Banner - originally "I am Rich". Main concepts:
    1. Using Scaffold to build a basic Material App Structure with
    2. Creating App Icon
2. Vietnamese Facts - originally "MiCard". Main concepts:
    1. Layouts with rows and columns
    2. Custom Fonts
    3. Cards
