# Flutter EduCamp - Vietnamese Language

## Introduction

This project tracks my progress on this course https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/learn/lecture/14482142 by Angela Yu.

This course is excellent for true beginner both in Flutter and in Programming. It combines clear
programming theories, Flutter knowledge, realistic challenges, and even personal, heartfell messages
from Angela along the way to aid the learning journey. Not to mention that the teacher's voice is so
 soothing I even watch the course videos on big screen TV as a way to wind down before bed time.

However, as the course targets absolute beginner, it spends time to go through the utmost basic
programming concepts like Variables, Loops, Conditionals, Object-Oriented Programming, etc, plus the
 challenges are designed in a progression so the first ones are really basic. **As a result, for
 experiences programmers coming from other  programming languagues the pace is quite slow**. I think
  it will be more effective for them to have
 some sign posts and tips based on the course excellent curriculum but then they can dive directly
 into the
 challenges (armed with Flutter documentation) instead of watching the full course.

 This git repo and app does just that: It showcase my own Vietnamese-Culture-inspired versions of
 the mini-apps, and for each of the mini-app, there are:
  - An overview introduction comparing the in-course app and my own version
  - A real-life demo that you can try on the device
  - A list of specific programming/Flutter concepts being taught in the mini-app, you can easily
  tick off the ones you already know, and do your own research on the new info
  - Source code for reference

## How to use the app

I recommend you to recreate each of the mini-app yourself, using Flutter. Try to put your own spin
on it, to make them really your own.

If you can get conquer all the mini-app challenges, that's great! You are well on your way to become
 a true Flutter Developer.

If you struggle understanding the concepts or building the apps, then I strongly recommend the Full
Course from Angela. It's worth 10x the price tag.
